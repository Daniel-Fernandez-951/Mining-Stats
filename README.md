### Mining-Stats

# Works on Python 2.x and Python 3.x (1/28/2017)

Get all miners on pool.bitcoin.com account; their hashrate individually. Also includes user stats, like how much is in the wallet and what the USD value of it is.


Sample output:

                    ----------------------MINER STATS-------------------------------------------
                                 TH/s Now  TH/s 10min Avg  TH/s 3hr Avg             Last Share
                  miner_01       15.55555       14.444444     12.222222  1776-13-13 05:55:55.0
                  miner_02       15.55555       13.333333     11.111111  1776-13-13 05:55:55.0




                  -----------------------USER STATS--------------------------------------------
                      Net HR 24h Avg  BTC Balance  BTC-USD  BCH Balance  BCH-USD
                  ->  30.003  19.920     0.000001  $123.45     0.000001  $123.45


When this program is run, https://api.coinbase.com/v2/prices/'PAIR'/spot is used to get current price of BCH and BTC. 
This data is placed in a Pandas DataFrame in KEY:VALUE format.



Limitations:

Can only do 2 or less miners. I am still working out, in my head, how I will make it scalable to accomidate X number of miners. 



Planned Upgrades:

1. Make this eyesore less of one (was talking about the readme).
2. Allow the program to be refreshed, user set time between refresh.
3. Get real fancy and add some colors; green will be an increase, while red will be a decrease since last refresh.
4. May skip #3 if I decide to go down the GUI route and see what the options are for this program couppled with a GUI.
5. Continue learning Python (started in June of 2017).
